# maestro
Home assistant lights orchestrator

## Compiling on macOS

```sh
swift build
```

See [docs/compile-macos.md](docs/compile-macos.md) for instructions on building
this package using Swift Package Manager on macOS.

## Running the server

Build and run the executable with Swift Package Manager. You can provide the
Home Assistant base URL and an optional longâ€‘lived access token. There is also
an option to simulate light commands instead of sending them:

```sh
swift run maestro
 --baseurl http://homeassistant.local:8123/ # base URL for the Home Assistant instance. The default is `http://homeassistant.local:8123/`
 --token YOUR_TOKEN # long lived Home Assistant token used for API calls
 --simulate # print light commands to stdout instead of sending them
 --program secondary # choose the light program to run (`default` or `secondary`)
```

The package builds on Linux and macOS. On macOS the POSIX server code uses the
`Darwin` module, so the same command works there as well.

## Requesting the server

### `GET /run`

This route triggers a run of the maestro pipeline.

Example request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/run
```

If the path is anything other than `/run`, the server responds with `404 Not
Found`.

## Pipeline

The maestro pipeline consists of 5 steps:

1. **STATE**: Fetches the current state of all entities from Home Assistant via the API. This includes light states, sensors, input selects, etc.

2. **CONTEXT**: Interprets the raw states into a structured `StateContext` that represents the current scene and environment. This includes:
   - Active scene (off, calm night, normal, bright, etc.)
   - Time of day (day/night)
   - Presence detection
   - TV/Hyperion status
   - Other environmental factors

3. **PROGRAM**: Uses the `StateContext` to compute the desired light states based on the current conditions. The program implements the lighting logic and rules for different scenes and situations.

4. **CHANGESET**: Optimizes the state changes to minimize unnecessary transitions. This ensures smooth operation and prevents lights from changing unnecessarily.

5. **LIGHTS**: Applies the final computed states to the physical lights through the Home Assistant API (or simulates the changes if in simulation mode).

This pipeline runs each time the `/run` endpoint is called, ensuring the lights always match the desired state based on current conditions.
